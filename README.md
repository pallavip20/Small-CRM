CRM helps businesses build a relationship with their customers. Customers can create tickets regarding issues they’ve had, and management can change the status of the ticket from pending to On-Going Process or Closed. In each ticket, the system also provides a remark part where customers can write a comment to discuss the status and further details about the feature.
